### What Is an MongoDB ?

MongoDB is a NoSQL (Non-SQL) database management system. It stores data in a document-oriented structure and uses BSON format, which is similar to JSON. MongoDB's flexible schema allows for dynamic changes to data models. This feature provides the advantage of quickly adapting to changes in application requirements. MongoDB's distributed database features enable it to effectively operate on large and scalable datasets.

Key features of MongoDB include:

• Document-oriented data model. 

• Flexible schema structure.

• JSON-like BSON format. 

• High-performance query processing.

• Automatic parallelization and support for distributed databases.
